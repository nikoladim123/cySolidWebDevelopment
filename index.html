                    purpose of this topic is to have a basic understanding of how a network
                    connection that uses TLS/SSL gets started and how this process may affect a
                    website’s performance and page load speed. Furthermore, let us try to make
                     sure that we install our TLS correctly, set up our server optimally and make
                     sure that the installed TLS gives us the intended protection against the bad

                      that most of us already know about. In this email, they stated that solidCodeUs had been chosen to
                      lead the development of a banking application, with a business model such as PayPal. They had also
                      demanded that the project needed to be fully developed and delivered  "in less than 5 weeks time".
                      In our reply, we emphasized the fact that there were so much involved in building a banking application
                      such as PayPal that it would make it impossible for us to successfully build and...

Depending on the complexity, developers of different skill levels are needed to code and create an enterprise level or a web based application. Once the application is built, a content management system would allow multiple administrators and users, with different permission levels to collaborate, create, manage, edit, archive and publish articles or other digital content. A CMS-based application may not be suited for each and every business model, but once it is put together professionally, it could offer many advantages such as cost, management and security.</p>

                  <p>For blogging and for personal use with small content type, WordPress is well suited and unsurpassed. For larger corporate websites and eCommerce sites however, one may want to consider its limited architecture, security vulnerabilities and the need for systematic changes which would increase the building cost substantially. WordPress plugging are plentiful, you have a development need, there a plugging for it. These plugging however, could be a major source of problems in site development and site maintenance, especially if they have been developed by rather unqualified people or may no longer be supported. Since it is such a popular CMS, it is also a favorite platform for hackers and it must be frequently updated with new versions. These updates alone could be a major source of headache as the functionality may break or the plugging may no longer work properly.</p>
